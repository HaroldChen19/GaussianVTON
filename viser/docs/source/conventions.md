# Frame Conventions

In this note, we describe the coordinate frame conventions used in `viser`.

## Scene tree naming

Each object that we add to the scene in viser is instantiated as a node in a
scene tree. The structure of this tree is determined by the names assigned to
the nodes.

If we add a coordinate frame called `/base_link/shoulder/wrist`, it signifies
three nodes: the `wrist` is a child of the `shoulder` which is a child of the
`base_link`.

If we set the transformation of a given node like `/shoulder`, both it and all
of its children will move. Its parent, `/base_link`, will be unaffected.

## Poses

Poses in `viser` are defined using a pair of fields:

- `wxyz`, a unit quaternion orientation term. This should always be 4D.
- `position`, a translation term. This should always be 3D.

These correspond to a transformation from coordinates in the local frame to the
parent frame:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

.. math::

   p_\mathrm{parent} = \begin{bmatrix} R \mid t \end{bmatrix}p_\mathrm{local}

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

where `wxyz` is the quaternion form of the :math:`\mathrm{SO}(3)` matrix
:math:`R` and `position` is the translation term :math:`t`.

## World coordinates

In the world coordinate space, +Z points upward.

## Cameras

All camera parameters exposed to the Python API use the COLMAP/OpenCV
convention:

- Forward: +Z
- Up: -Y
- Right: +X

Confusingly, this is different from Nerfstudio, which adopts the OpenGL/Blender
convention:

- Forward: -Z
- Up: +Y
- Right: +X

Note that conversion between the two is a simple 180 degree rotation around the
X-axis.
